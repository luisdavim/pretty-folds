## FAQ

> How can I see what this plugin actually does?

The [source][] is authoritative.

Feel free to [let me know][GitHub issues] which setting you object to, so I
can reassess whether it makes sense to include it.

## Contributing

I want this to be a plugin nobody objects to installing.  [Let me
know][GitHub issues] if you have any objections to *anything*.

Feel free to ask a question if you're not sure why I've set something, as I
haven't put much effort into documenting that.
